      {
        question: "What is Panic Ring and how does it work?",
        answer: "Panic Ring is an advanced personal safety device that combines a wearable ring with a smartphone app. When you press the ring button or activate SOS in the app, it instantly sends emergency alerts to your designated contacts with your live GPS location updating every 3 seconds. The system includes fall detection, automatic police contact, and works even if your SIM card is removed through IMEI tracking.",
      },
      {
        question: "What devices are compatible with Panic Ring?",
        answer: "Panic Ring works with all modern Android (5.0+) and iOS (12+) smartphones. The ring connects via Bluetooth Low Energy. The web app works on any modern browser.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the battery last?",
        answer: "The Panic Ring wearable lasts up to 7 days on standby with normal use. The app runs continuously in the background with minimal battery drain thanks to optimized GPS polling.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Safety Features",
    items: [
      {
        question: "How does fall detection work?",
        answer: "The ring's built-in accelerometer detects sudden impacts and unusual motion patterns associated with falls. If a fall is detected and you don't respond within 30 seconds, an SOS is automatically triggered.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens when I activate SOS?",
        answer: "When SOS is triggered, your emergency contacts receive an immediate WhatsApp message and email with your real-time location, a Google Maps link, and your custom emergency message. Your location updates every 3 seconds until the alert is resolved.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use the app without the ring?",
        answer: "Yes. The app works fully as a standalone safety app with the SOS button, GPS tracking, fake call, and audio recording features — even without the physical ring.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Subscription & Pricing",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What is included in the Basic plan?",
        answer: "The Basic plan (R50/mo) includes up to 3 emergency contacts, real-time GPS tracking, SOS alerts via WhatsApp & email, and 7-day alert history.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
        answer: "Yes, you can change your subscription plan at any time from Settings → Subscription. Changes take effect immediately.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a free trial?",
        answer: "Yes, all new users start with a 14-day free trial of the Standard plan. No credit card required.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Privacy & Security",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Is my location data secure?",
        answer: "Yes. All location data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Your location is only ever shared with your chosen emergency contacts and only during active SOS events.",
      },
      {
        question: "Who can see my emergency alerts?",
        answer: "Only the emergency contacts you explicitly add to your profile receive your alerts. Panic Ring staff do not have access to your personal alert data.",
      },
